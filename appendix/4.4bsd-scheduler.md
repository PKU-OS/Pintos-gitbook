# 4.4BSD Scheduler

**The goal of a general-purpose scheduler is to balance threads' different scheduling needs.**

* **Threads that perform a lot of I/O** require a fast response time to keeps input and output devices busy, but need little CPU time.&#x20;
* On the other hand, **compute-bound threads** need to receive a lot of CPU time to finish their work, but have no requirement for fast response time.&#x20;
* **Other threads lie somewhere in between**, with periods of I/O punctuated by periods of computation, and thus have requirements that vary over time.&#x20;
* **A well-designed scheduler can often accommodate threads with all these requirements simultaneously.**

<mark style="color:red;">**For project 1, you must implement the scheduler described in this appendix.**</mark> Our scheduler resembles the one described in \[[McKusick](bibliography.md#operating-system-design-references)], which is **one example of a **_**multilevel feedback queue**_** scheduler**.&#x20;

* This type of scheduler **maintains several queues of ready-to-run threads**, where **each queue holds threads with a different priority**.&#x20;
* At any given time, the scheduler **chooses a thread from the highest-priority non-empty queue**.&#x20;
* If the highest-priority queue contains multiple threads, then they run in **"round robin**" order.
* **Multiple facets of the scheduler require data to be updated after a certain number of timer ticks. **<mark style="color:red;">****</mark> In every case, these updates should occur **before** any ordinary kernel thread has a chance to run, so that there is no chance that a kernel thread could see a newly increased `timer_ticks()` value but old scheduler data values.
* **The 4.4BSD scheduler does not include priority donation.**

## Niceness

**Thread priority is dynamically determined by the scheduler using a formula given below.** However, each thread also has an integer _**nice**_ value that determines how "nice" the thread should be to other threads.&#x20;

* A nice of **zero** does **not** **affect** thread priority.&#x20;
* A **positive** nice, to **the maximum of 20**, decreases the priority of a thread and causes it to give up some CPU time it would otherwise receive.&#x20;
* On the other hand, a **negative** nice, to **the minimum of -20**, tends to take away CPU time from other threads.
* **The initial thread starts with a nice value of **_**zero**_**.** **Other threads start with a nice value **_**inherited**_** from their parent thread.**&#x20;

You must implement the functions described below, which are for use by test programs. We have provided skeleton definitions for them in `threads/thread.c`.

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: int thread\_get\_nice (void)**</mark>
  * **Returns the current thread's **_**nice**_** value.**
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void thread\_set\_nice (int new\_nice)**</mark>
  * **Sets the current thread's **_**nice**_** value to **_**new\_nice**_** and recalculates the thread's priority based on the new value** (see section [Calculating Priority](4.4bsd-scheduler.md#calculating-priority)).&#x20;
  * If the running thread no longer has the highest priority, **yields**.

## Calculating Priority

**Our scheduler has 64 priorities and thus 64 ready queues, numbered 0 (`PRI_MIN`) through 63 (`PRI_MAX`).**&#x20;

* **Lower numbers** correspond to **lower priorities**, so that priority 0 is the lowest priority and priority 63 is the highest.&#x20;
* **Thread priority is calculated initially at **_**thread initialization**_**.**&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">**It is also recalculated**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**once every fourth clock tick**</mark><mark style="color:red;">**, for every thread.**</mark> In either case, it is determined by the formula

$$
priority =PRI\_MAX-\frac{1}{4}\cdot recent\_cpu-2\cdot nice
$$

* where _**recent\_cpu**_ is an estimate of the CPU time the thread has used recently (see below) and _**nice**_ is the thread's _nice_ value.&#x20;
* **The result should be rounded down to the **<mark style="color:red;">**nearest**</mark>** integer (truncated).** The coefficients 1/4 and 2 on _recent\_cpu_ and _nice_, respectively, have been found to work well in practice but lack deeper meaning. **The calculated priority is always adjusted to lie in the valid range `PRI_MIN` to `PRI_MAX`.**
* **This formula gives a thread that has received CPU time recently lower priority for being reassigned the CPU the next time the scheduler runs.** This is key to preventing starvation: a thread that has not received any CPU time recently will have a _recent\_cpu_ of 0, which barring a high _nice_ value should ensure that it receives CPU time soon.

## Calculating _recent\_cpu_

**We wish **_**recent\_cpu**_** to measure how much CPU time each process has received "**_**recently**_**."**

* Furthermore, as a refinement, **more recent CPU time should be weighted more heavily than less recent CPU time.**&#x20;
* **One approach would use an array of n elements to track the CPU time received in each of the last n seconds.** However, this approach requires O(n) space per thread and O(n) time per calculation of a new weighted average.
* Instead, we **use an **_<mark style="color:red;">**exponentially weighted moving average**</mark>_, which takes this general form:

$$
x(0)=f(0)\\x(t)=a\cdot x(t-1)+f(t)\\a={\frac{k}{k+1}}
$$

* where **x(t)** is the moving average at integer time t ≥ 0, **f(t)** is the function being averaged, and **k** **> 0** controls the rate of decay.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>More about the formula</summary>

We can iterate the formula over a few steps as follows:

**x(1) = f(1),**

**x(2) = a\*f(1) + f(2),**

**...**

**x(5) = (a**_^_**4)\*f(1) + (a^3)\*f(2) + (a^2)\*f(3) + a\*f(4) + f(5).**

**...**

* The value of f(t) has a weight of 1 at time t, a weight of a at time t+1, a^2 at time t+2, and so on.
* **We can also relate x(t) to k**: f(t) has a weight of approximately 1/e at time t+k, approximately 1/(e^2) at time t+2\*k, and so on.&#x20;
* From the opposite direction, **f(t) decays to weight w at time t + ln(w)/ln(a).**

</details>

* **The initial value of **_**recent\_cpu**_** is 0 **_**in**_**  **_**the first thread created**_**, or **_**the parent's value**_** in other new threads.**&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">**Each time**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**a timer interrupt occurs**</mark><mark style="color:red;">**,**</mark><mark style="color:red;">** **</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**recent\_cpu**</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">** **</mark><mark style="color:red;">**is incremented by 1 for the running thread only, unless the idle thread is running.**</mark>&#x20;
* In addition, <mark style="color:red;">**once**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**per second**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;">**the value of**</mark><mark style="color:red;">** **</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**recent\_cpu**</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">** **</mark><mark style="color:red;">**is recalculated for every thread (whether running, ready, or blocked)**</mark>, using this formula:

$$
recent\_cpu = \frac{2\cdot load\_avg}{2\cdot load\_avg + 1}\cdot  recent\_cpu + nice
$$

* where _**load\_avg**_ is a moving average of the number of threads ready to run (see below).&#x20;
  * If _load\_avg_ is 1, indicating that a single thread, on average, is competing for the CPU, then the current value of recent\_cpu decays to a weight of .1 in ln(.1)/ln(2/3) = approx. 6 seconds;&#x20;
  * if load\_avg is 2, then decay to a weight of .1 takes ln(.1)/ln(3/4) = approx. 8 seconds.&#x20;
  * The effect is that _recent\_cpu_ estimates the amount of CPU time the thread has received "recently," with **the rate of decay inversely proportional to the number of threads competing for the CPU**.

You must implement `thread_get_recent_cpu()`, for which there is a skeleton in `threads/thread.c`.

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: int thread\_get\_recent\_cpu**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**(void)**</mark>
  * **Returns **<mark style="color:red;">**100 times**</mark>** the current thread's **_**recent\_cpu**_** value, rounded to the **<mark style="color:red;">**nearest**</mark>** integer.**

### Notes

* Assumptions made by some of the tests require that **these recalculations of **_**recent\_cpu**_** be made** exactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of a second, that is, **when **<mark style="color:red;">**`timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0`**</mark>**, and not at any other time**.
* **The value of **_**recent\_cpu**_** can be negative** for a thread with a negative _nice_ value. <mark style="color:red;">**Do not clamp negative**</mark><mark style="color:red;">** **</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**recent\_cpu**</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">** **</mark><mark style="color:red;">**to 0.**</mark>
* **You may need to think about **<mark style="color:red;">**the order of calculations**</mark>** in this formula.** We recommend computing the coefficient of _recent\_cpu_ first, then multiplying. Some students have reported that multiplying _load\_avg_ by _recent\_cpu_ directly can cause overflow.

## Calculating _load\_avg_

**Finally, **_**load\_avg**_**, often known as the system load average, estimates the average number of threads ready to run over the past minute.**&#x20;

* Like _recent\_cpu_, it is **an **<mark style="color:red;">**exponentially weighted moving average**</mark>.&#x20;
* Unlike _priority_ and _recent\_cpu_, _load\_avg_ is **system-wide, not thread-specific**.&#x20;
* **At system boot, it is initialized to 0.**&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">**Once**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**per second**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;">**thereafter, it is updated**</mark> according to the following formula:

$$
load\_avg=\frac{59}{60}\cdot load\_avg +\frac{1}{60}\cdot ready\_threads
$$

* where _**ready\_threads**_ is the number of threads that are **either running or ready to run at time of update (not including the idle thread)**.

You must implement `thread_get_load_avg()`, for which there is a skeleton in `threads/thread.c`.

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: int**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**thread\_get\_load\_avg**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**(void)**</mark>
  * **Returns **<mark style="color:red;">**100 times**</mark>** the current system load average, rounded to the **<mark style="color:red;">**nearest**</mark>** integer.**

### Notes

* Because of assumptions made by some of the tests, _**load\_avg**_** must be updated** exactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of a second, that is, **when **<mark style="color:red;">**`timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0`**</mark>**, and not at any other time**.

## Scheduler Summary

**The following formulas summarize the calculations required to implement the scheduler. They are not a complete description of scheduler requirements**.

* Every thread has **a **_**nice**_** value** between -20 and 20 directly under its control.&#x20;
* Each thread also has **a **_**priority**_, between 0 (`PRI_MIN`) through 63 (`PRI_MAX`), which is **recalculated** using the following formula <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**every fourth tick**</mark>:

$$
priority =PRI\_MAX-\frac{1}{4}\cdot recent\_cpu-2\cdot nice
$$

* _**recent\_cpu**_** measures the amount of CPU time a thread has received "recently."**&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**On each timer tick**</mark>, the running thread's _recent\_cpu_ is **incremented** by 1.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**Once per second**</mark>, every thread's _recent\_cpu_ is **updated** this way:

$$
recent\_cpu = \frac{2\cdot load\_avg}{2\cdot load\_avg + 1}\cdot  recent\_cpu + nice
$$

* _**load\_avg**_** estimates the average number of threads ready to run over the past minute.** It is initialized to 0 at boot and **recalculated** <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**once per second**</mark> as follows, where _**ready\_threads**_ is the number of threads that are either running or ready to run at time of update (not including the idle thread).

$$
load\_avg=\frac{59}{60}\cdot load\_avg +\frac{1}{60}\cdot ready\_threads
$$

## Fixed-Point Real Arithmetic

In the formulas above, _priority_, _nice_, and _ready\_threads_ are integers, but _recent\_cpu_ and _load\_avg_ are real numbers. **Unfortunately, **<mark style="color:red;">**Pintos does not support floating-point arithmetic**</mark>** in the kernel, because it would complicate and slow the kernel.**&#x20;

* Real kernels often have the same limitation, for the same reason.&#x20;
* This means that **calculations on real quantities must be simulated using integers**.&#x20;
* This is not difficult, but many students do not know how to do it. This section explains the basics.

### Basics

**The fundamental idea is to treat the rightmost bits of an integer as representing a fraction.**&#x20;

* For example, we can designate the lowest 14 bits of a signed 32-bit integer as fractional bits, so that an integer x represents the real number x/(2^14), where ^ represents exponentiation.&#x20;
* This is called **a 17.14 fixed-point number representation**, because there are **17 bits before the decimal point**, **14 bits after it**, and **one sign bit**.&#x20;
* A number in 17.14 format represents, at maximum, a value of (2^31 - 1)/(2^14) = approx. 131,071.999.

Suppose that we are using **a p.q fixed-point format**, and let **f = 2^q**.&#x20;

* By the definition above, we can **convert an integer or real number into p.q format** **by multiplying with f**. For example, in 17.14 format the fraction 59/60 used in the calculation of _load\_avg_, above, is 59/60\*(2^14) = 16,110.&#x20;
* **To convert a fixed-point value back to an integer, divide by f.**&#x20;
  * The normal `/` operator in C rounds toward zero, that is, it rounds positive numbers down and negative numbers up.&#x20;
  * To round to nearest, add **`f / 2`** to a positive number, or subtract it from a negative number, before dividing.)
* **Many operations on fixed-point numbers are straightforward.** Let `x` and `y` be fixed-point numbers, and let `n` be an integer.&#x20;
  * Then the sum of `x` and `y` is `x + y` and their difference is `x - y`.&#x20;
  * The sum of `x` and `n` is `x + n * f`; difference, `x - n * f`; product, `x * n`; quotient, `x / n`.
* **Multiplying two fixed-point values has two complications.**&#x20;
  * **First, the decimal point of the result is q bits too far to the left.** Consider that (59/60)\*(59/60) should be slightly less than 1, but 16,111\*16,111 = 259,564,321 is much greater than 2^14 = 16,384. **Shifting q bits right**, we get 259,564,321/(2^14) = 15,842, or about 0.97, the correct answer.&#x20;
  * **Second, the multiplication can overflow even though the answer is representable.** For example, 64 in 17.14 format is 64\*(2^14) = 1,048,576 and its square 64^2 = 4,096 is well within the 17.14 range, but 1,048,576^2 = 2^40, greater than the maximum signed 32-bit integer value 2^31 - 1. **An easy solution is to do the multiplication as a 64-bit operation.** The product of `x` and `y` is then `((int64_t) x) * y / f`.
* **Dividing two fixed-point values has opposite issues.**&#x20;
  * **The decimal point will be too far to the right, which we fix by shifting the dividend q bits to the left before the division.** The left shift discards the top q bits of the dividend, which we can again fix by **doing the division in 64 bits**. Thus, the quotient when `x` is divided by `y` is `((int64_t) x) * f / y`.

<mark style="color:red;">**This section has consistently used multiplication or division by f, instead of q-bit shifts,**</mark> for two reasons.&#x20;

* First, multiplication and division do not have the surprising **operator** **precedence** of the C shift operators.&#x20;
* Second, multiplication and division are **well-defined on negative operands**, but the C shift operators are not. Take care with these issues in your implementation.

### Fixed-Point Summary

<mark style="color:red;">**The following table summarizes how fixed-point arithmetic operations can be implemented in C.**</mark> In the table, `x` and `y` are fixed-point numbers, `n` is an integer, fixed-point numbers are in signed p.q format where p + q = 31, and `f` is `1 << q`:
